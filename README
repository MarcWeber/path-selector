Be even faster. Example: Just type C /hm to change directory to /home/marc

usage:
  path-selector.sh pat1 pat2 pat3

  path-selector.sh is kind of xpath for directories/ files
  you should use it with cd, vim etc to be most productive

  pattern selector description:
  first char is "/" means set path2 to root

  The rest of the pattern selector is split by @ - , :
  @ : @foo expands to f*/o*/o* . This is default
  : : :foo expands to *f*o*o*
  = : regex match
  , : exact match or glob pattern. Examples:
      ,*.txt -> *.txt
      ,exact -> exact
  -nr : go to parent directory nr times
    -3 = ../../..

  + : append trailing path2 which doesn't exist yet
      eg /t+bar expands to /tmp/bar even if /tmp/bar doesn't exist

  trailing / : match directories only

  Now you can put pieces together:
  /tt -> /tmp/this # file or directory
  /tt/ -> /tmp/this # directory only

  When beeing in /tmp/this:
    -2hm -> ../../home/m*

  etc

  Useful shell functions:

    C()   { cd       $(path-selector.sh "$@"); }
    E()   { $EDITOR  $(path-selector.sh "$@"); }
    MDC() { mdc      $(path-selector.sh "$@"); }

  Instead of path-selector.sh you can source path-selector.sh by
  AS_LIB source path-selector.sh 
  and use match as shown in main below.
